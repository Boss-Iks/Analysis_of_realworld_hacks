# Analysis_of_realworld_hacks
This repository contains a list of PDFs (which I will update over time) that provide a preliminary analysis of real-world cyber attacks. I create these reports to become more familiar with the cybersecurity industryâ€™s terminology, understand the problems that arise across different sectors, study the TTPs (tactics, techniques, and procedures) that attackers employ, and learn about the technologies used in organizational environments that ultimately get compromised. Ultimately, it's just a passion project.
