# Analysis_of_realworld_hacks
This repository contians a list of pdfs I will update over time that contain a prelemenary analysis of real world cyber attacks.
The reason why I do these reports is to get more familiar with the industry linguo (in this case cybersecurity industry), as well as to learn what are the problem that arise on different industries, the TTPS that attackers use and 
to learn of the technologies that are used on organisational settings that get compromised.
